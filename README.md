### Overview
The **Smart Waste Management System** is an innovative solution designed to optimize waste collection and disposal using IoT-enabled smart bins. The system monitors bin fill levels in real-time, provides alerts when bins reach 85% capacity, and suggests optimized routes for waste collection, ensuring efficient waste management in urban areas.

### Problem Statement
Traditional waste management systems often face inefficiencies such as overflowing bins, unnecessary collection trips, and lack of real-time monitoring. This leads to increased costs, environmental hazards, and unhygienic conditions.

### Solution
Our solution integrates IoT-based smart bins equipped with ultrasonic sensors to monitor waste levels. The data is sent to a web dashboard and a Flutter mobile app, enabling authorities to track fill levels, optimize waste collection routes, and ensure timely disposal.

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Flask-RESTful API
- **IoT Integration**: Ultrasonic sensors, ESP8266/Arduino
- **Mobile App**: Flutter (Dart)

### Key Features
- **Real-time Waste Level Monitoring**: Ultrasonic sensors track bin fill levels.
- **Automated Alerts**: Notifications sent to the mobile app when a bin is 85% full.
- **Optimized Waste Collection Routes**: Algorithm suggests the best routes for collection vehicles.
- **Web & Mobile Dashboard**: Live monitoring via React-based web app and Flutter mobile app.
- **Admin Panel for Waste Management Authorities**: Provides insights and analytics.
